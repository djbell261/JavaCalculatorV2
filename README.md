# Java Swing Calculator

A simple calculator application built in **Java** using **Swing** and **IntelliJ IDEA**.  
This project demonstrates GUI development, event handling, and basic arithmetic logic.

---

## Overview
The calculator provides a graphical interface that allows users to perform common arithmetic operations using on-screen buttons. All input is handled through button clicks, and results are displayed in a non-editable text field.

---

## Features
- Number input (0–9)
- Decimal support
- Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Modulo (`%`) operation
- Positive/negative toggle
- Clear and delete functionality
- Chained calculations

---

## Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **Swing (JFrame, JPanel, JButton, JTextField)**
- **ActionListener** for event handling
- **IntelliJ IDEA**

---

## How It Works
- The application window is created using a `JFrame`
- Buttons are organized in a grid layout
- User interactions are handled through the `ActionListener` interface
- Arithmetic operations are performed using `double` values to support decimals

---

## How to Run
1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Run the `Calculator` class
3. Use the on-screen buttons to perform calculations

---

## Purpose
This project was created to practice:
- Java GUI development
- Event-driven programming
- Object-oriented design concepts
- Git/GitHub project workflow
